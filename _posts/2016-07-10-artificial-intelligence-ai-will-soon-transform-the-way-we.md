      Enterprise software is about to undergo radical transformation - a
      substantial change that will make the shift to software as a service
      (SaaS) look like a simple facelift. This transformation is being powered
      by machine learning. With machine learning, computers can process and mine
      data in real time to automatically discover insights and generate
      predictive models.
