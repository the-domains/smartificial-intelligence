      As the Pepper robot f rom Softbank scurries about your home or office, it
      reads your emotions by your words, tone of voice, facial expressions, and
      body language. It then responds in all those ways; its hands and posture
      in particular are remarkably expressive.

  In 1936, whilst studying for his Ph.D. at Princeton University, the English
  mathematician Alan Turing published a paper, " On Computable Numbers, with an
  application to the Entscheidungsproblem," which became the foundation of
  computer science. In it Turing presented a theoretical machine that could
  solve any problem that could be described by simple instructions encoded on a
  paper tape.
