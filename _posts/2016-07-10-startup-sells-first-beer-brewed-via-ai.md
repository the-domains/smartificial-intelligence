  One of the quirkier applications of IBM's Watson AI engine has been in the
  creation of new recipes. It scours a global database of existing recipes and
  concocts novel new combinations that have yet to be tried. Whilst this is
  still largely in an experimental mode, a London-based startup is using AI in
  creating products for the real world.
