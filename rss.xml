            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Alan Turing Invented the Computer Age</h1><p>In 1936, whilst studying for his Ph.D. at Princeton University, the English mathematician Alan Turing published a paper, " On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem," which became the foundation of computer science. In it Turing presented a theoretical machine that could solve any problem that could be described by simple instructions encoded on a paper tape.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>18 artificial intelligence researchers reveal the profound changes coming to our lives</h1><p>Oli Scarff/Getty Images Artificial intelligence (AI) has been changing our lives for decades, but never has AI felt more ubiquitous than now. It seems as though not a week passes without yet another AI system overcoming an unprecedented hurdle or outperforming humans. But how the future of AI will pan out for humans remains to be seen.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/359ac536086e42e0a5618619922ce853/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic5.techinsider.io%2Fimage%2F53a886bbecad04b06c9abc75-3112-2334%2Frobot-hand-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>John McCarthy (computer scientist) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h1><p>John McCarthy (September 4, 1927 - October 24, 2011) was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist. McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He coined the term " artificial intelligence" (AI), developed the Lisp programming language family, significantly influenced the design of the ALGOL programming language, popularized timesharing, and was very influential in the early development of AI.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/db04350539e21f2426c98634dadb2fb5/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F4%2F49%2FJohn_McCarthy_Stanford.jpg%2F200px-John_McCarthy_Stanford.jpg"></article>]]></description>
