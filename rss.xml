            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Alan Turing Invented the Computer Age</h1><p>In 1936, whilst studying for his Ph.D. at Princeton University, the English mathematician Alan Turing published a paper, " On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem," which became the foundation of computer science. In it Turing presented a theoretical machine that could solve any problem that could be described by simple instructions encoded on a paper tape.</p></article>]]></description>
